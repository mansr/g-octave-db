Title: Octave Symbolic Package using SymPy
Description: Adds symbolic calculation features to GNU Octave.
 These include common Computer Algebra System tools such as algebraic
 operations, calculus, equation solving, Fourier and Laplace transforms,
 variable precision arithmetic and and other features.  Internally, the
 package uses [SymPy](www.sympy.org), but no knowledge of Python is
 required.  Compatibility with other symbolic toolboxes is a goal.
